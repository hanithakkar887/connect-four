# Connect Four Game

## Overview
This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Connect Four game. It allows two players to take turns dropping tokens into a 7x6 grid until one player achieves four in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or the board fills up, resulting in a draw. The game includes sound effects, background music, and a theme toggle (dark/light mode) for an enhanced user experience.

## Features
- **Two-player gameplay**: Players take turns dropping red and yellow tokens into the board.
- **Winner detection**: The game checks for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal four-in-a-row victories.
- **Draw detection**: If the board fills up without a winner, the game declares a draw.
- **Sound effects & music**: Includes sounds for token drops, wins, and draws, along with background music.
- **Dark & light mode**: Players can toggle between dark and light themes for better visual experience.
- **Restart functionality**: Players can reset the game at any time.
